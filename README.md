## First notice of our intended project
- In this project, I will be creating a webpage using Angular.
- It will be linked to an API as well.

# I am using a music API for this project
- For this experiment I will use the Genius Lyrics API.
- This will be a database of sorts; with knowledge on several songs and lyrics as well as the references of those lyrics.
- It will also track the SFX, quotes, and other music sampled in the song a user searched.

# User Stories:
- I wanted to get the lyrics of the latest song.
- Listening to some music the other day, I found it sounded familiar to something else I heard and got curious about the samples the artist used.
